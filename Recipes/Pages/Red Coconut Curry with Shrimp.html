                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. 
                        Add onion, bell pepper, and jalapeno and cook until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. 
                        Use a slotted spoon to transfer veggies to a bowl and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce heat to medium and add coconut milk, curry paste, brown sugar, 
                        and fish sauce to the pan. Whisk together and bring to a gentle boil.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Combine cornstarch and water in a small bowl; whisk to dissolve. 
                        Add to sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pat shrimp dry and add to the sauce along with the cooked veggies. 
                        Allow curry to simmer gently, stirring occasionally, 
                        until shrimp are cooked through and opaque, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                        Top with Thai basil and serve with lime wedges.
